#This system represents an or gate with 2 inputs. (a b) is input 1 and (c d) is input 2.
#The constraints for this system require that the output (e f) is free.
#Reaching a stable configuration is only possible if at least one of input 1 and input 2 exist in the system.
#Try un-commenting them to see.
