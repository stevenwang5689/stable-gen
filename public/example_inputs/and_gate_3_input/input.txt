#This system represents an and gate with 3 inputs. (a b) is input 1, (c d) is input 2, and (g h) is input 3.
#In logic, this system represents "Stable configuration found == true iff input1 && input2 && input3"
#The constraints for this system require that the output (i j) is free.
#Reaching a stable configuration is only possible if both input 1 and input 2 exist in the system.
#Try un-commenting them to see.
