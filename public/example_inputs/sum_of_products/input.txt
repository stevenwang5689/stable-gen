#This system represents an or gate with 2 and gates feeding into it as its input.
#(a b) is input 1, (c d) is input 2, (g h) is input 3, (i j) is input4.
#In logic, this system represents "Stable configuration found == true iff (input1 && input2) || (input3 && input4)"
#The constraints for this system require that the output (e f) is free.
#Reaching a stable configuration is only possible if both input 1 and input 2 exist in the system.
#Try un-commenting them to see.
